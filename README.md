# Orders-Analysis-using-Python


### In this project I performed simple analysis and visualization to: 
####       - Identify the most profitable customer segment based on order value and converted sales.
####       - Analyzing the conversion rate of orders over time.

### using python on a dataset from 'Kaggel'.


### Steps of the project:

####        - Check if the data needs to be cleaned.
####        - Perform some simple aggregations and EDA.
####        - Use seaborn to visualize the data.
